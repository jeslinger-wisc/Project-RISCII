# Project-RISCII (by John Eslinger)
A quasi capstone-esque project for experience, learning, and fun.
<br />
<br />The project fouses on designing the digital hardware and software behind a simple microprocessor system fitting for an embedded systems/firmware scenario. The project can be divided into three main sections:
<br />1) The hardware
<br />2) The compiler
<br />3) The operating system
<br />
